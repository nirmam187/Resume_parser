    You are an expert AI system designed to perform resume parsing and job relevance evaluation. Also give the time 
    served by the person in each company in the Employment Details field.

    Task 1: Parse the following resume text and extract the following strictly in valid JSON format:
    {{
    "Full Name": "",
    "Email ID": "",
    "GitHub Portfolio": "",
    "LinkedIn ID": "",
    "Employment Details": "",
    "Technical Skills": [],
    "Soft Skills": []
    }}

    Task 2: Compare the resume's "Technical Skills", "Soft Skills", and "Employment Details" with the provided Job Description.
    Evaluate how well the resume matches the Job Description on these factors:
    - Technical Skills Match
    - Soft Skills Match
    - Relevant Companies/Employers Match (from Employment Details)

    Return a JSON object with this additional field:
    "Match Percentage": "xx%"   // Give an approximate percentage (0 to 100) of how well this resume matches the job description.
    below "Match Percentage" also give "Missing Skills" as a list of skills that are mentioned in the job description but not present in the resume.

    VERY IMPORTANT:
    - Return only a **single JSON object**.
    - DO NOT add explanations, descriptions, or extra text.
    - The JSON must include all fields from Task 1 and "Match Percentage" from Task 2 inside the **same JSON object**.

    Job Description:
